A continuously evolving personal website project — built to share my thoughts, notes, research ideas, and creative work, all under my own domain name.

## ✨ Overview
This repository contains the source code for my **personal website**, where I plan to publish:
- 🧠 Research notes and technical articles  
- ✍️ Personal blog posts and reflections  
- 🖼️ Image galleries and project showcases  
- 🌍 Portfolio and contact information  

The site will be designed to be **fully customizable**, **easy to update**, and **accessible from anywhere**.  
My goal is to create a space that grows together with my ideas and projects.

- Host all content online for **global accessibility**
- Continuously update modules, notes, and media files
