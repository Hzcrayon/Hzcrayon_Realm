# Personal Website Project 🌐

This repository contains the source files for my personal website.  
The goal of this project is to build a fully customized online space where I can share my notes, research ideas, images, and personal updates — all under my own domain name.

I want this website to serve as a dynamic platform that I can update anytime, from anywhere, to document my projects and thoughts.  
It will eventually include different modules such as:
- ✍️ Blog & research notes  
- 🧠 Learning records  
- 🖼️ Image and project gallery  
- 🌍 Personal portfolio and contact information  

Everything will be hosted online and accessible from any network, allowing me to continuously grow and improve the content over time.
